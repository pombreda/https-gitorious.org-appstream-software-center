the computer easy and consistent.

= Developer notes =

All non UI code must come with tests in the test/ subdirectoy.

== useful debug environment ==

SOFTWARE_CENTER_IPSUM_REVIEWS - geneate random reviews
SOFTWARE_CENTER_OLD_PATHBAR - use old pathbar code
SOFTWARE_CENTER_SEARCHES_SORT_MODE={popcon,alphabetic,xapian}

== aptdaemon ==
 * the dbus limits for the system bus are rather low, this means that
   adding  <limit name="max_match_rules_per_connection">512</limit> 
   and using something bigger than 512 is a good idea

The following environment is suported:

SOFTWARE_CENTER_USE_GCONF_PROXY - set user proxy instead of using system-wide
