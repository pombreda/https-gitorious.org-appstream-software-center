Webkit:
- xpm images can not be loaded
- the human icons for the categories are only 24x24
- no keyboard nagvigation in the widgets



UI:
- add warning if a package is removed that causes the removal
  of a unreleated meta-package (that is not ubuntu-desktop)
- make the textview more visual attractive (GtkTextView has
  probably too many limitations, switch to the webkit branch
- connect the menu items from the "Edit" menu
- make "installed" and "available" two fully seperate internal
  tabs and change the "installed" main page to not show 
  categories but use a different view (spec says treeview, lets
  see if that can be done in time)
- implement the removal dialog in the way the spec calls for
  it (different ui design)
- implement warning when a package contains of multiple apps
  and show the apps in this case
- implement the spinning icon for pending transactions. while
  we have a animatedimage (that works fine) it won't work
  inside a Treeview. so we need a custom cell renderer that
  can render normal pixbufs and animated pixbufs

Missing:
- when the xapian db is rebuilding (e.g. because app-center is 
  upgraded) wait for that (just like with the apt cache)
- pimping of apps (via tweaking the popcon values?)

Missing (hard):
- keep track of all pending transactions in the apt cache and when
  a transaction finishes. 
- when a package is marked for install, block its (and the other 
  pkgs that get installed) action button in the app details view.
- think more about all the possible cases with manipulating 
  pkgs that are also in a queue of pending transactions and the
  UI implications that have:
  e.g.:
  - A depends on B
  - A is in the queue for install (but not installed now)
  - B is installed now
  - the user clicks on removal of B 
  -> what should the UI say? 
     "removal of B will result in the removal of A that will get "
     "installed at some point in the future?"
  -> what implications does cancel of transactions have? 
     we need re-calculate the cache when a cancel happens
  -> what about transactions that come from outside of 
     software-store

Missing functionality compared to g-a-i:
- maintainance calculation
- displaying EULA
- enable of components (like universe)

Missing but not so important:
- searching for codecs (now done by gnome-codec-install)
- searching for mime-types (?)

- Provide terminal in transactions (?)
