UI:
- add warning if a package is removed that causes the removal
  of a unreleated meta-package (that is not ubuntu-desktop)
- make the textview more visual attractive (GtkTextView has
  probably too many limitations, switch to the webkit branch
- connect the menu items from the "Edit" menu
- make "installed" and "available" two fully seperate internal
  tabs and change the "installed" main page to not show 
  categories but use a different view (spec says treeview, lets
  see if that can be done in time)
- implement the removal dialog in the way the spec calls for
  it (different ui design)
- implement warning when a package contains of multiple apps
  and show the apps in this case

Missing:
- when the xapian db is rebuilding (e.g. because app-center is 
  upgraded) wait for that (just like with the apt cache)
- pimping of apps (via tweaking the popcon values?)

Missing functionality compared to g-a-i:
- maintainance calculation
- displaying EULA
- enable of components (like universe)

Missing but not so important:
- searching for codecs (now done by gnome-codec-install)
- searching for mime-types (?)

- Provide terminal in transactions (?)
