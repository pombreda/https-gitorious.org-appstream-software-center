Missing:
- when the xapian db is rebuilding (e.g. because app-center is 
  upgraded) wait for that (just like with the apt cache)
- add sanity checks for the cache on removal (e.g. removal of
  ubuntu desktop?)

- pimping of apps (via tweaking the popcon values?)

Missing functionality compared to g-a-i:
- maintainance calculation
- enable of channels (like the third party repository)
- displaying EULA
- enable of components (like universe)



Missing but not so important:
- searching for codecs (now done by gnome-codec-install)
- searching for mime-types (?)
