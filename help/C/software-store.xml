    <title>What is the Ubuntu Software Store?</title>
    <para>
    The Ubuntu Software Store is a virtual catalog of thousands of free
    applications available for Ubuntu.
    You can find applications by category or by searching,
    and you can install an application with the click of a button.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Store also lets you examine the applications installed on the
      computer already,
      and remove those you no longer need.
    </para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="installing">
    <title>Installing a program</title>
    <para>
      To install a program from the Store,
      you need administrator access and a working Internet connection.
      (If you set up Ubuntu on this computer yourself,
      you have administrator access automatically.)
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          In the <guilabel>Get Free Software</guilabel> section,
          find the program you want to install.
          If you already know its name, try typing the name in the search field.
          Or try searching for the type of program you want
          (like &#8220;spreadsheet&#8221;).
          Otherwise, browse the Store departments to find the program.
        </para>

          Click the program in the list, and click the arrow button to go to the

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Click the <guilabel>Install</guilabel> button.
          You may need to enter your Ubuntu password
          before the installation can begin.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      How long a program takes to install depends on how large it is,
      and the speed of your computer and Internet connection.
    </para>
    <para>
      While a program is being installed,
      it appears in the Store&#8217;s <guilabel>In Progress</guilabel> section.
      As soon as it disappears, the program is installed.

      Most installed applications appear
      in the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu in the corner of the screen,
      in the same category as they came from in the Store.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, if you installed a program from the
      <guilabel>Office</guilabel> department, it will appear inside
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Applications</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Office</guisubmenu></menuchoice>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Applications for configuring the computer system may appear inside
      <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu></menuchoice> or
      <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu></menuchoice>.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are using Ubuntu Netbook Remix,
      an application appears in its category on the home screen.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some items, such as media playback or Web browser plugins,
      do not appear in the menus.
      They are used automatically when Ubuntu needs them.
      For a Web browser plugin, you may need to close the browser and
      reopen it before the plugin will be used.

      If a program is open when you remove it,

    >Why is it asking me to remove several programs together?</title>
    <para>
      Sometimes if you try to remove one program,
      the Store will warn you that other programs will be removed too.
      There are two main reasons this happens.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you remove an application, any add-ons or accessories
          for that application usually will be removed too.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Multiple applications are sometimes provided as a single
          &#8220;package&#8221;.
          If any of them are installed, all of them are installed.
          And if any of them are removed, all of them are removed.
          The Store cannot remove them individually,
          because it has no instructions on how to separate them.
        </para>

    <para>
      You can use <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Preferences</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Main Menu</guimenuitem></menuchoice> to hide unwanted
      items from the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu without
      removing the actual programs.
